## REACHING VARAŽDIN

You can reach the city of Varaždin by several means of transportation: bus, train, car and airplane. From more distant parts of the Europe and the rest of the world, our guests usually fly in to Zagreb first. To get from the Zagreb airport (called Franjo Tuđman airport) to the town of Varaždin you have two options:

Public transportation: There is a direct bus shuttle to the Zagreb Central bus station. From there you can take a bus to Varaždin. See the travel schedule here.

Taxi or van: Renting a car or taking a taxi are fairly more expensive alternatives than a bus ride to Varaždin, but they're a good option if you will have fellow travelers. Inside the Franjo Tuđman Airport building you can find several rent-a-car service providers with all the necessary information. You can also book your trip sooner using online taxi booking. One of the possibilities is available here.

The official currency in Croatia is the Croatian Kuna (KN). 1 EUR ~ 7,3 to 7,5 KN. In most of the stores and restaurants you can pay with your debit and credit cards. ATMs work with the most common cards and this is the easiest way to get your Kunas while in Croatia.
