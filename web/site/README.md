# What is BSidesVarazdin?

BSidesVarazdin is a vendor neutral technical information security symposium in Croatia.

We strive to be a place where professionals and hackers regardless of gender, race or background can meet on neutral ground and exchange ideas and knowledge, and discuss current topics, trends and problems in the broad topic of information security.


## When and where?

At 18.9.2019 (Wednesday) - Park Boutique Hotel Varaždin

Or more simply, it's the Wednesday after [Balccon.](https://2k19.balccon.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## What are our values?

We want intellectual sustenance, we do not want only form, fear mongering or sales pitches. We want high quality content, knowledge, experience and expertise to be shared with our attendees. We want to hear the latest thoughts and points of view from professionals, freelancers, consultants, governmental and law enforcement branches to hackers of all hat colors from a neutral, unbiased perspective.

When we say vendor neutral, we don’t mean we dislike businesses or people that work professionally in the area of information security, we know no one wants sales talks when they want to educate themselves and network. We do want businesses to show off on what they are doing and their expertise.

0 EUR / HRK. This is a community focused event. We will have a registration form in a few weeks, which will enable you to attend, but there is no payment or tickets to be had. Keep in mind, you do need to register to enter the venue as we have a limited number of seats available.

Registrations will be opened soon!
