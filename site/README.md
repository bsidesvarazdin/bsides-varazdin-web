# What is BSidesVarazdin?

BSidesVarazdin is a vendor neutral technical information security symposium in Croatia.

We strive to be a place where professionals and hackers regardless of gender, race or background can meet on neutral ground and exchange ideas and knowledge, and discuss current topics, trends and problems in the broad topic of information security.

## What are our values?

We want intellectual sustenance, we do not want only form, fear mongering or sales pitches. We want high quality content, knowledge, experience and expertise to be shared with our attendees. We want to hear the latest thoughts and points of view from professionals, freelancers, consultants, governmental and law enforcement branches to hackers of all hat colors from a neutral, unbiased perspective.

When we say vendor neutral, we don’t mean we dislike businesses or people that work professionally in the area of information security, we know no one wants sales talks when they want to educate themselves and network. We do want businesses to show off on what they are doing and their expertise.

## Why should I sponsor BSidesVarazdin?

You can imagine that costs are high for maintaining a conference like BSidesVarazdin. You want to support us because you want to:

Support the state of information security knowledge sharing in Croatia.
Hear lectures that will be presented from experts from Croatia and abroad and help bring those experts to this conference.
Connect and network with people with the same interest in information security.
If you need to employ people, there is no better location to find potential new talent and experts. Students interested in information security are also present at the conference, so you can easily find potential junior and senior talent.
You want to support this cause and you want to make sure this congress will grow each year.
